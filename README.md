# TensorflowSudoku

This code is based on the code from the following github project:
https://github.com/shivaverma/Sudoku-Solver

While using his code as a general outline, I have added my own take on each part of the code. My additions/changes to the code was as follows:

Tensorboard to track and graph the loss over each epoch
Loading/progress bar for the processing of data
Saving the model using checkpoints
Testing out different model parameters
Changing how the model was trained (optimizers, crossvalidation, etc.)
Modifications to the final prediction of a board's solution
