# TensorflowSudoku

This code is based on the code from the following github project:
https://github.com/shivaverma/Sudoku-Solver

While using his code as a general outline, I have added my own take on each part of the code. My additions/changes to the code was adding a progress bar for the loading of data, testing out different models/optimizers, changing how the model is trained, and modifications to the prediction algorithm for solving a sudoku step by step.
