# TensorflowSudoku

This code is based on the code from the following github project:
https://github.com/shivaverma/Sudoku-Solver

While using his code as a general outline, I have added my own take on each part of the code. My additions/changes to the code was as follows:

Tensorboard to track and graph the loss over each epoch

Loading/progress bar for the processing of data

Randomization of order of input data

Saving the model using checkpoints

Testing out different model parameters

Changing how the model was trained (optimizers, crossvalidation, etc.)

Modifications to the final prediction of a board's solution
